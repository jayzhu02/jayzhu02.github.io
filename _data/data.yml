        authors: Junwen Chen, Jie Zhu, Yu Kong
        conference: CVPR'23 submitted


research-experiences:
    - title: Fairness in robot learning
      time: Mar 2022 - Present
      school: Cognitive Robotics and AI Lab (CRAI), Kent State University
      advisor: Rui Liu
      details: |
        - Proposed 4 fairness issues to evaluate robot bias during interaction with people in the restaurant environment.
        - Design two models for robot bias detection and bias mitigation. Define the reward function according to the fairness
          issues.
        - Building an interactive environment and robot simulation using the MuJoCo platform.
        - a questionnaire was designed to survey people’s attitudes toward the robot’s behavior, and 1,000 preferences
          data were simulated for the robot’s bias detection model.
        - Proposed a method of "Bias detection guidance" to mitigate robot bias during learning.

    - title: Video question answering (VQA)
      time: Feb 2022 - Present
      school: ACTION Lab, Rochester Institute of Technology
      advisor: Yu Kong
      details: |
        - Proposed a method of Category and Signal encoding to improve Temporal question answering.
        -  Introduced Action Temporality Modeling (ATM) for causal/temporal reasoning.
        -  Enhancing the video representation by incorporating the motion stream that is appearance free to capture
           the precise motion.
        -  Training the visual-text encoding by contrastive learning in an action-centric manner, leading to better
           action representations in both vision and text modalities.
